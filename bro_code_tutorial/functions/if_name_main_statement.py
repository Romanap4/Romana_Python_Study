# if__name__ == __main__: (this script can be imported OR run standalone)
# functions and classes in this module can be reused without the main block of code executing
# Good practice (code is modular, helps readability, leaves no global variables, avoid unintended execution)                

# it can be used when you want the functionality of a program without executing the main body of code
# e.g. library = Import library for functionality
#                When running library directy, display a help page

# def main():
    # Your program goes here

# if __name__ == '__main__':
#     main()
